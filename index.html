   About Me
 </h2>   
   <p id= "abouttext">
     Hello! My name is Katie. I've been programing since 4th grade, althought then we used tools like Sketch that were more about the content in coding and less about the languages. This coding class is the first time I've ever physicaly typed out the code, and I'm having a blast! So far, I dont have plans to go into a field that required coding knowledge, but I'd love to keep it as a hobby
